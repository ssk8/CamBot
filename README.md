# Auto camera tracker
in action: https://youtu.be/omu7OnxMOV8
This is an expansion on my PoC auto-tracking camera system. The first one worked but had some major shortcomings which I'm trying to address.

Steps in setup-pi are needed to get the RF24 working on the Raspberry Pi. I'm not sure if it will run as a shell script

HQZ.stl is the mount I designed to attach the HQ camera to the Pi Zero (probably better described the other way around)

tx is Feather M0 express with protowing for radio/gps attachemnt

base is Pi Zero with proto hat to hold peripherals: miniTFT, trinket M0 (for stepper driver), radio
