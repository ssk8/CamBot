# Auto camera tracker
in action: https://youtu.be/omu7OnxMOV8

This is an expansion on my PoC auto-tracking camera system. The first one worked but had some major shortcomings which I'm trying to address.

Steps in setup-pi are needed to get the RF24 working on the Raspberry Pi. I'm not sure if it will run as a shell script

The mount I designed to attach the HQ camera and the Pi can be found at https://www.thingiverse.com/stinkyskate/designs

The transmiter is a Feather M0 express with protowing for radio/gps attachemnt

The base station is a Pi 3A+ with HQcam and lens, proto hat with buttons, sdd1306 oled, trinket M0 (for stepper driver), radio
